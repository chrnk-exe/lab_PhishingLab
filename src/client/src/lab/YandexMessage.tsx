						{`Knowing the
						password isn't always enough to log into an account. In
						certain cases, Yandex conducts an additional security
						check. If there aren't any suspicious logins in your
						account's login history, then you
						can be sure that whoever was trying to get into your
						account couldn't pass that extra check. In that case,
						your account is safe, but you still need to change the
						password to one known only to you. `}
